1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the derivation of the content-encryption key
   for COSE.  The use of this mechanism provides protection against
   where the attacker manipulates the content-encryption algorithm
   identifier.  This attack has been demonstrated against CMS and the
   mitigation can be found in [I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-cek-hkdf-sha256].
   This attack is generic and can apply to other protocols with similar
   characteristics, such as COSE.  However, the attack requires several
   preconditions:

   1.  The attacker intercepts a COSE Encrypt payload that uses either
       AES-CCM or AES-GCM [RFC5084].

   2.  The attacker converts the intercepted content into a "garbage"
       COSE Encrypt payload composed of AES-CBC guess blocks.

   3.  The attacker sends the "garbage" message to the victim, who then
       reveals the result of the decryption to the attacker.

   4.  If any of the transformed plaintext blocks match the guess for
       that block, then the attacker learns the plaintext for that
       block.

   With highly structured messages, one block can reveal the only
   sensitive part of the original message.

   This attack is thwarted if the encryption key depends upon the
   delivery of the unmodified algorithm identifier.

   The mitigation for this attack has two parts:

   *  Potential recipients include a new parameter, cek-hkdf, in the
      outermost protected header of the COSE_Encrypt payload to indicate
      support for this mitigation.  This parameter MUST use the value
      true.

   *  Perform encryption with a derived content-encryption key or
      content-authenticated-encryption key.  The new CEK' is the result
      of deriving a CEK.  This key derivation uses the alg parameter
      found in the outermost COSE_Encrypt header.

   CEK' = HKDF(CEK, COSE_Encrypt.alg)

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Use of of HKDF with SHA-256 to Derive Encryption Keys

   The mitigation uses the HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation
   Function (HKDF) [RFC5869] to derive output keying material (OKM) from
   input key material (IKM).  HKDF is used with the SHA-256 hash
   function [FIPS180].

   If an attacker were to change the originator-provided COSE_Encrypt
   algorithm identifier then the recipient will derive a different
   content-encryption key.

   The CEK_HKDF function uses the HKDF-Extract and HKDF- Expand
   functions to derive the OKM from the IKM:

   Inputs:
     IKM        Input keying material
     alg        COSE_Key algorithm identifier

   Output:
     OKM      output keying material (same size as IKM)

   The output OKM is calculated as follows:

     OKM_SIZE = len(IKM)
     IF OKM_SIZE > 8160 THEN raise error

     salt = "CBOR Object Signing and Encryption"
     PRK = HKDF-Extract(salt, IKM)

     OKM = HKDF-Expand(PRK, alg, OKM_SIZE)

4.  Security Considerations

   This mitigation always uses HKDF with SHA-256.  One KDF algorithm was
   selected to avoid the need for negotiation.  In the future, if a
   weakness is found in the KDF algorithm, a new attribute will need to
   be assigned for use with an alternative KDF algorithm.

   If the attacker removes the cek-hkdf header parameter from the
   COSE_Encrypt header prior to delivery to the recipient, then the
   recipient will not attempt to derive CEK', which will deny the
   recipient access to the content, but will not assist the attacker in
   recovering the plaintext content.

   If the attacker changes the value of the COSE_Encrypt alg parameter
   prior to delivery to the recipient, then the recipient will derive a
   different CEK', which will not assist the attacker in recovering the
   plaintext content.  Providing the algorithm identifer as an input to
   the key derivation function is sufficient to mitigate the attack
   described in [RS2023], but this mitigation includes both the object
   identifier and the parameters to protect against some yet-to-be-
   discovered attack that only manipulates the parameters.

   Implementations MUST protect the content-encryption keys, this
   includes the CEK and CEK'.  Compromise of a content-encryption key
   may result in disclosure of the associated encrypted content.
   Compromise of a content-authenticated-encryption key may result in
   disclosure of the associated encrypted content or allow modification
   of the authenticated content and the additional authenticated data
   (AAD).

   Implementations MUST randomly generate content-encryption keys and
   content-authenticated-encryption keys.  Content key distribution
   methods are described in Section 8.5 of [RFC9052] and in Section 6 of
   [RFC9053].  These algorithms define derivation and protection of
   content-encryption keys.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add a new header parameter to the "COSE Common
   Header Parameters" established with [RFC9052].
