        CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) Key Thumbprint
                   draft-ietf-cose-key-thumbprint-05

Abstract

   This specification defines a method for computing a hash value over a
   CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) Key. It defines which
   fields in a COSE Key structure are used in the hash computation, the
   method of creating a canonical form of the fields, and how to hash
   the byte sequence.  The resulting hash value can be used for
   identifying or selecting a key that is the subject of the thumbprint.

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines a method for applying a cryptographic hash
   function (a.k.a. thumbprint) to a CBOR Object Signing and Encryption
   (COSE) Key structure [RFC9052].  It defines which fields in a COSE
   Key structure are used in the hash computation, the method of
   creating a canonical form for those fields, and how to hash the byte
   sequence.  The resulting hash value can be used for identifying or
   selecting the key that is the subject of the thumbprint, for
   instance, by using the COSE Key Thumbprint value as a "kid" (key ID)
   value.  The use of the thumbprint of the key as a naming scheme is
   one of the main use cases of this document.  Another use case are key
   derivation functions that utilize the thumbprints of the public keys
   of the endpoints, as well as other context, to the derived symmetric
   key.

Internet-Draft             COSE Key Thumbprint                 July 2024


   This specification defines how thumbprints of COSE keys are created,
   see Section 3 and Section 4.  Additionally, a new CBOR Web Token
   (CWT) confirmation method is added to the IANA "CWT Confirmation
   Methods" registry created by [RFC8747].  See Section 3.1 of [RFC8747]
   for details about the use of a confirmation claim in a CWT with a
   proof-of-possession key.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  COSE Key Thumbprint

   The thumbprint of a COSE Key MUST be computed as follows:

   1.  Construct a COSE_Key structure (see Section 7 of [RFC9052])
       containing only the required parameters representing the key as
       described in Section 4 of this document.

   2.  Apply the deterministic encoding described in Section 4.2.1 of
       [RFC8949] to the representation constructed in step (1).

   3.  Hash the bytes produced in step (2) with a cryptographic hash
       function H.  For example, SHA-256 [RFC6234] may be used as a hash
       function.

   The resulting value is the COSE Key Thumbprint with H of the COSE
   Key. The details of this computation are further described in
   subsequent sections.

   The SHA-256 hash algorithm MUST be supported, other algorithms MAY be
   supported.

4.  Required COSE Key Parameters

   Only the required parameters of a key's representation are used when
   computing its COSE Key Thumbprint value.  This section summarizes the
   required parameters.

   The "kty" (label: 1) element MUST be present for all key types and
   the integer value found in the IANA COSE Key Types registry MUST be
   used.  The tstr data type is not used with the kty element.

   Many COSE Key parameters depend on the chosen key type.  The
   subsection below list the required parameters for commonly used key
   types.

4.1.  Octet Key Pair (OKP)

   The required parameters for elliptic curve public keys that use the
   OKP key type, such as X25519, are:

   *  "kty" (label: 1, data type: int, value: 1)

   *  "crv" (label: -1, value: int)

   *  "x" (label: -2, value: bstr)

   Details can be found in Section 7.1 of [RFC9053].

4.2.  Elliptic Curve Keys with X- and Y-Coordinate Pair

   The required parameters for elliptic curve public keys that use the
   EC2 key type, such as NIST P-256, are:

   *  "kty" (label: 1, data type: int, value: 2)

   *  "crv" (label: -1, data type: int)

   *  "x" (label: -2, data type: bstr)

   *  "y" (label: -3, data type: bstr)

   Details can be found in Section 7.1 of [RFC9053].

   Note: [RFC9052] offers both compressed as well as uncompressed point
   representations.  For interoperability, implementations following
   this specification MUST use the uncompressed point representation.
   Hence, the y-coordinate is expressed as a bstr.  An implementation
   that uses the compressed point representation MUST compute the
   uncompressed representation for the purpose of the thumbprint
   calculation.

4.3.  RSA Public Keys

   The required parameters for an RSA public key are:

   *  "kty" (label: 1, data type: int, value: 3)

   *  "n" (label: -1, data type: bstr)

Internet-Draft             COSE Key Thumbprint                 July 2024


   *  "e" (label: -2, data type: bstr)

4.4.  Symmetric Keys

   The required parameters for a symmetric key are:

   *  "kty" (label: 1, data type: int, value: 4)

   *  "k" (label: -1, data type: bstr)

4.5.  HSS-LMS

   The required parameters for HSS-LMS keys are:

   *  "kty" (label: 1, data type: int, value: 5)

   *  "pub" (label: -1, data type: bstr)

4.6.  Others

   As other key type values are defined, the specifications defining
   them should be similarly consulted to determine which parameters, in
   addition to the "kty" element, are required.

5.  Miscellaneous Considerations

5.1.  Why Not Include Optional COSE Key Parameters?

   Optional parameters of COSE Keys are intentionally not included in
   the COSE Key Thumbprint computation so that their absence or presence
   in the COSE Key does not alter the resulting value.  The COSE Key
   Thumbprint value is a digest of the parameters required to represent
   the key as a COSE Key -- not of additional data that may also
   accompany the key.

   Optional parameters are not included so that the COSE Key Thumbprint
   refers to a key -- not a key with an associated set of key
   attributes.  Different application contexts might or might not
   include different subsets of optional attributes about the key in the
   COSE Key structure.  If these were included in the calculation of the
   COSE Key Thumbprint, the values would be different for those COSE
   Keys, even though the keys are the same.  The benefit of including
   only the required parameters is that the COSE Key Thumbprint of any
   COSE Key representing the key remains the same, regardless of any
   other attributes that are present.

Internet-Draft             COSE Key Thumbprint                 July 2024


   Different kinds of thumbprints could be defined by other
   specifications that might include some or all additional COSE Key
   parameters, if use cases arise where such different kinds of
   thumbprints would be useful.

5.2.  Selection of Hash Function

   A specific hash function must be chosen by an application to compute
   the hash value of the hash input.  For example, SHA-256 [RFC6234]
   might be used as the hash function by the application.  While SHA-256
   is a good default choice at the time of writing, the hash function of
   choice can be expected to change over time as the cryptographic
   landscape evolves.

   Note that in many cases, only the party that creates a key will need
   to know the hash function used.  A typical usage is for the producer
   of the key to use the thumbprint value as a "kid" (key ID) value.  In
   this case, the consumer of the "kid" treats it as an opaque value
   that it uses to select the key.

   However, in some cases, multiple parties will be reproducing the COSE
   Key Thumbprint calculation and comparing the results.  In these
   cases, the parties will need to know which hash function was used and
   use the same one.

5.3.  Thumbprints of Keys Not in COSE Key Format

   Keys that are in other formats can be represented as COSE Keys.  Any
   party in possession of COSE Keys can use the COSE Key Thumbprint.

5.4.  Relationship to Digests of X.509 Values

   COSE Key Thumbprint values are computed on the COSE Key object
   required to represent a key, rather than all parameters of a COSE Key
   that the key is represented in.  Thus, they are more analogous to
   applications that use digests of X.509 Subject Public Key Info (SPKI)
   values, which are defined in Section 4.1.2.7 of [RFC5280], than to
   applications that use digests of complete certificate values, as the
   "x5t" (X.509 certificate SHA-1 thumbprint) [RFC9360] value defined
   for X.509 certificate objects does.  While logically equivalent to a
   digest of the SPKI representation of the key, a COSE Key Thumbprint
   is computed over the CBOR representation of that key, rather than
   over an ASN.1 representation of it.

5.5.  Confirmation Method

   [RFC8747] introduced confirmation methods for use with CBOR Web
   Tokens (CWTs) with the addition of the "cnf" claim.  CWTs have been
   defined in [RFC8392].  This specification adds a new confirmation
   method based on COSE Key Thumbprints.

   The proof-of-possession key is identified using the "ckt" claim, the
   COSE Key Thumbprint claim.  This claim contains the value of the COSE
   Key Thumbprint encoded as a binary string.  Instead of communicating
   the actual COSE Key only the thumbprint is conveyed.  This approach
   assumes that the recipient is able to obtain the identified COSE Key
   using the thumbprint contained in the "ckt" claim.  In this approach,
   the issuer of a CWT declares that the presenter possesses a
   particular key and that the recipient can cryptographically confirm
   the presenter's proof of possession of the key by including a "ckt"
   claim in the CWT.

   The following example demonstrates the use of the "ckt" claim in a
   CWT as part of the confirmation method (with line-breaks inserted for
   editorial reasons):

      {
       /iss/ 1 : "coaps://as.example.com",
       /aud/ 3 : "coaps://resource.example.org",
       /exp/ 4 : 1361398824,
       /cnf/ 8 : {
         /ckt/ [[TBD1]] : h'496bd8afadf307e5b08c64b0421bf9dc
                     01528a344a43bda88fadd1669da253ec'
        }
      }

   Section 8 registers the "ckt" claim and the confirmation method.  The
   "ckt" claim is expected to be used in the "cnf" claim.

5.6.  COSE Key Thumbprint URIs

   This specification defines Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to
   represent a COSE Key Thumbprint value.  The design follows the work
   of the JSON Web Key (JWK) Thumbprint URIs, specified in [RFC9278].
   This enables COSE Key Thumbprints to be used, for example, as key
   identifiers in contexts requiring URIs.  This specification defines a
   URI prefix indicating that the portion of the URI following the
   prefix is a COSE Key Thumbprint.

   The following URI prefix is defined to indicate that the portion of
   the URI following the prefix is a COSE Key Thumbprint:




Isobe, et al.            Expires 9 January 2025                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             COSE Key Thumbprint                 July 2024


     urn:ietf:params:oauth:ckt

   To make the hash algorithm being used explicit in a URI, the prefix
   is followed by a hash algorithm identifier and a COSE Key Thumbprint
   value, each separated by a colon character to form a URI representing
   a COSE Key Thumbprint.

   Hash algorithm identifiers used in COSE Key Thumbprint URIs MUST be
   values from the "Hash Name String" column in the IANA "Named
   Information Hash Algorithm Registry" [IANA.Hash.Algorithms].  COSE
   Key Thumbprint URIs with hash algorithm identifiers not found in this
   registry are not considered valid and applications will need to
   detect and handle this error, should it occur.

   Since the URN is encoded as a string, the output of the COSE Key
   Thumbprint computation described in Section 3 MUST be base64url
   encoded without padding.

   [RFC7515] specifies Base64url encoding as follows:

   "Base64 encoding using the URL- and filename-safe character set
   defined in Section 5 of RFC 4648 [RFC4648], with all trailing '='
   characters omitted and without the inclusion of any line breaks,
   whitespace, or other additional characters.  Note that the base64url
   encoding of the empty octet sequence is the empty string.  (See
   Appendix C of [RFC7515] for notes on implementing base64url encoding
   without padding.)"

   The base64url encoding of the thumbprint shown in Section 6 is shown
   below (with a line-break added for readability purposes).

   The full example of a COSE Key Thumbprint URI is shown below, again
   with a line-break added.

6.  Example

   For better readability, the example is first presented in CBOR
   diagnostic format (with the long line broken for display purposes
   only).

   The example above corresponds to the following CBOR encoding (with
   link breaks added for display purposes only):

   16E642E6578616D706C65

   Not all of the parameters from the example above are used in the COSE
   Key Thumbprint computation since the required parameters of an
   elliptic curve public key are (as listed in Section 4.2) "kty",
   "crv", "x", and "y".

   The resulting COSE Key structure, in CBOR diagnostic format with
   line-breaks added for better readability, with the minimum parameters
   in the correct order are.

7.  Security Considerations

   A COSE Key Thumbprint will only uniquely identify a particular key if
   a single unambiguous COSE Key representation for that key is defined
   and used when computing the COSE Key Thumbprint.

   If two asymmetric keys are used by different parties with different
   key identifiers then the COSE Key Thumbprints will still be equal
   since the key identifier itself is not included in the thumbprint
   calculation (similarly to other optional parameters in the COSE_Key
   structure).  When the inclusion of certain optional parameters in the
   thumbprint calcuation is important for a given application, this
   specification is not the appropriate choice.

   While thumbprint values are useful for identifying legitimate keys,
   comparing thumbprint values is not a reliable means of excluding the
   use of particular keys (or transformations thereof).  The reason is
   that an attacker may supply a key that is a transformation of a key
   in order to have it appear to be a different key.  For instance, if a
   legitimate RSA key uses a modulus value N and an attacker supplies a
   key with modulus 3*N, the modified key would still work about 1/3 of
   the time, but would appear to be a different key.

   Producing thumbprints of symmetric keys needs to be done with care.
   Developers MUST ensure that the symmetric key has sufficient entropy
   to prevent attackers to precompute tables of symmetric keys with
   their corresponding hash values.  This can be prevented if the
   symmetric key is a randomly selected key of at least 128 bit length.
   Thumbprints MUST NOT be used with passwords or other low-entropy
   secrets.  If a developer is unable to determine whether all symmetric
   keys used in an application have sufficient entropy, then thumbprints
   of symmetric keys MUST NOT be used.  In general, using thumbprints of
   symmetric keys should only be used in special applications.  In most
   other deployment scenarios it is more appropriate to utilize a
   different naming scheme for key identifiers.

8.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the following entry to the IANA "CWT
   Confirmation Methods" registry established by [RFC8747]:

   *  Confirmation Method Name: ckt

   *  Confirmation Method Description: COSE Key SHA-256 Thumbprint

Internet-Draft             COSE Key Thumbprint                 July 2024


   *  JWT Confirmation Method Name: jkt

   *  Confirmation Key: [[TBD1]]

   *  Confirmation Value Type(s): binary string

   *  Change Controller: IETF

   *  Specification Document(s): [[This document]]

   Furthermore, IANA is requested to add a value to the IANA "OAuth URI"
   registry established with [RFC6755]:

   *  URN: urn:ietf:params:oauth:ckt

   *  Common Name: COSE Key Thumbprint URI

   *  Change controller: IETF

   *  Specification Document: [[This document]]
